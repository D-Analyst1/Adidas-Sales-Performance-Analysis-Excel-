## **Introduction:**

Adidas, a global leader in the sportswear industry, is evaluating its sales performance across products, regions, retailers, and sales channels. Despite a strong overall sales figure of $899.9 million and a profit of over $332 million, the management seeks deeper insights into which products and regions are driving performance, how retailers and sales methods contribute to revenue, and how seasonal trends affect unit sales.

The marketing and operations teams are particularly interested in:

* Identifying top-performing and underperforming product categories.

* Understanding geographic market contributions.

* Optimizing sales strategies across different sales methods and retail channels.

* Leveraging time-based sales trends for demand forecasting and promotional planning.

## **Objectives of the project:**

**1. Product Performance Evaluation:**

* Compare unit sales and revenue across product categories.

* Identify the best-selling and least-performing product lines.

**2.  Geographic Sales Insights:**

* Analyze total sales distribution across regions and top 10 cities.

* Determine which cities and regions contribute most to overall revenue.

**3. Retailer Impact Assessment:**

* Evaluate sales volume by retailer (e.g., West Gear, Foot Locker, Walmart).

* Provide recommendations on which retailers to strengthen or optimize partnerships with.

 **4. Sales Channel Effectiveness:**

* Compare unit sales across In-store, Online, and Outlet methods.

* Identify the most profitable and scalable channels.

**5. Monthly Sales Trends:**

* Detect peak and off-peak months for strategic planning.

* Understand seasonality and its impact on sales volume.

**6. Performance Benchmarking:**

* Track overall key metrics such as Total Units Sold, Total Sales, Profit, and Average Price.

* Establish benchmarks for future performance comparisons.
